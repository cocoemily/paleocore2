Paleo Core Project

Installation
------------------
* Clone repository from GitHub and move into that directory
```
git clone https://github.com/paleocore/paleocore2.git paleocore
cd paleocore
```

* Create virtual Python environment
```
virtualenv -p python3 venv
```

* Start the virtual environment and install the python libraries stipulated in the requirements file. Separate files stipulate a base set of libraries which are imported into dev and production requirement files.
```
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
```

* Create the database. Assuming the database software is installed. The default database for this project uses postgreSQL. The simplest method of implementing the database is using postgres.app.
```
createdb paleocore2
```

* Update the following libraries manually:
<!---```
cd venv/lib/python3.7/site-packages
```

"""
Fastkml is a library to read, write and manipulate kml files. It aims to keep
it simple and fast (using lxml if available). Fast refers to the time you spend
to write and read KML files as well as the time you spend to get aquainted to
the library or to create KML objects. It provides a subset of KML and is aimed
at documents that can be read from multiple clients such as openlayers and
google maps rather than to give you all functionality that KML on google earth
provides.
